## Introduction 

This case study is part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course and will focus on analysing data about a fictional bike-sharing company called Cyclistic.

### Stakeholders

> 1. **Cyclistic** -> A bike-share program includes over 5,800 bikes and 600 docking stations, with adaptive options for 8% of users, and 30% using bikes for daily commuting.
> 2. **Lily Moreno** -> The marketing director, spearheads campaigns across multiple channels to promote the bike-share program.
> 3. **Cyclistic marketing analytics team** -> A team of data analysts that guides Cyclistic's marketing strategy through data collection, analysis, and reporting.

### About the Company 

Since 2016, Cyclistic's bike-share program has grown to include 5,824 bicycles across 692 stations in Chicago, allowing users to unlock and return bikes at any station. While initially targeting broad consumer segments, the focus now shifts to converting casual riders into annual members for greater profitability, with the marketing team planning to analyze historical trip data to inform targeted strategies.

## Process 

### Ask => Business Task 

> 1. *How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?*
> 2. *Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?*
> 3. *How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?*
